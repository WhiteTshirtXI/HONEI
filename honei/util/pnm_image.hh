         * Reads an image in pgm-format, and returns values in floating point scaled between 0 and 1.
         *
         * From http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html:
         *
         * Each PGM image consists of the following:
         *
         * 1. A "magic number" for identifying the file type. A pgm image's magic
         *    number is the two characters "P5".
         * 2. Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).
         * 3. A width, formatted as ASCII characters in decimal.
         * 4. Whitespace.
         * 5. A height, again in ASCII decimal.
         * 6. Whitespace.
         * 7. The maximum gray value (Maxval), again in ASCII decimal. Must be less
         *    than 65536, and more than zero.
         * 8. A single whitespace character (usually a newline).
         * 9. A raster of Height rows, in order from top to bottom. Each row
         *    consists of Width gray values, in order from left to right. Each gray
         *    value is a number from 0 through Maxval, with 0 being black and Maxval
         *    being white. Each gray value is represented in pure binary by either 1
         *    or 2 bytes. If the Maxval is less than 256, it is 1 byte. Otherwise,
         *    it is 2 bytes. The most significant byte is first.
         *
         * A row of an image is horizontal. A column is vertical. The pixels in the
         * image are square and contiguous.
         *
         * Each gray value is a number proportional to the intensity of the pixel,
         * [...]
         * Note that a common variation on the PGM format is to have the gray value
         * be "linear," [...]. pnmgamma takes such a PGM variant as input and produces
         * a true PGM as output.
         *
         * Strings starting with "#" may be comments, the same as with PBM.
